# Summary

Implements Pi-Hole v6 in a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi 5 Alpine Linux machine. Includes changes to support the Unbound package and Unbound functionality.

# Process
## Alpine Linux

The Raspberry Pi 5 can run Alpine Linux through the image available on the official Raspberry Pi Imager, or the image that the Alpine Linux Foundation [provides](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/). The image used in this setup was the `.tar` download for the steps explained in the ['Challenges' section](#Challenges).
