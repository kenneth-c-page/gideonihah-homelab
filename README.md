# Overview
This repository includes documentation markdown files for ongoing projects in my homelab. It's intended to later host these documenation files as a sort of blog on a personal website.
The intended projects are as follows:

# Why the Name?
As a latter-day saint of Jesus Christ, and thus as a Christian, I've admired the stories of Gideon from the book of Judges and the Book of Mormon. Following a naming convention from the Book of Mormon civilizations (e.g., Nephihah, etc.), I thought it would be fun parodying these names with Gideon's, hence 'Gideonihah.'
